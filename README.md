Everybody can agree on that "Data is worthless if you don't communicate It correctly". It needs to be presented in a meaningful manner. 

DS helps to achieve this with two focused tasks

1.  Create a dashboard (visually) with data visualization and share it across different organizational roles
2.  Create Microsites to present growing information of a focused domain - There can be certain cases that the requirement is not a single dashboard, in such cases, you can create a microsite which can be a collection of dashboards and other textual/dynamic web pages

DS has an enterprise store integrated, where users can bookmark the dashboards, microsites and data visualization
widgets they are fond of.

The store has a direct link when creating dashboards. When an organization user creates a new dashboard he can pick and choose items from the store to add to his dashboard

DS is powered by [WSO2 Carbon](http://wso2.com/products/carbon) & [Jaggeryjs](http://jaggeryjs.org)
