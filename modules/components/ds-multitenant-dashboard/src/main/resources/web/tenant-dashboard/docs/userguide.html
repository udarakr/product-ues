<p>
 WSO2 Dashboard Server (DS) provides a tool set to create dashboards and visualizations for enterprise requirements.
 Unlike traditional solutions, DS exposes the power of the server to the dashboard or the app developer.
 The dashboards and microsites created via DS are stored as Jaggery apps, where developers have full flexibility to work with Jaggery APIs to retrieve,
 manipulate and compose data.
