<h1>WSO2 Dashboard Server ${product.version} Release Notes</h1>

<p>
    The WSO2 Dashboard Server (formerly WSO2 User Engagement Server) helps to rapidly create visually appealing and
    engaging web components such as dashboards, and gadgets, and unlocking data for business intelligence and monitoring.
    With the host of capabilities that Dashboard Server provides out-of-the-box, going from data to screen has never been easier.

    WSO2 Dashboard Server (DS) works with any WSO2 product as part of our underlying platform.
    Dashboard requirements for WSO2 products such as Data Analytics Server and Complex Event Processor
    are handled by Dashboard Server.

    Dashboard Server alleviates this by providing a set of features that allow you to visually compose,
    build, and deploy data interfaces to the public or to private users, visualizing data from databases,
    WebSockets and more. An enterprise web store allows users to share gadgets with one another -
    users can build dashboards and gadgets with any data source and share them among authenticated or
    anonymous users across the enterprise. Dashboards are secure, supporting single sign on, and with this new release,
    can be individually customized by users to suit their needs.
